Welcome to my personal information page. I gave a breif introduction of myself in the homepage, and here I will expand upon my journey in engineering. I grew up in Woodbridge, VA and have lived there since I was 6 years old. I have been always interested in computers and engineering as a whole. In middle school I was in a program called VA STAR where we refurbished old computers which we donated back to the community. In high school I participated in my school's 4 year computer science program. This program gave me a good foundation on basic programming which gave me a headstart once I entered college. After graduation I hope to be in a role that combines robotics and embedded systems programming.



Below you will find a summary of my education, experience, skills, and personal projects.
