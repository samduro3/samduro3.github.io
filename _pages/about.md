Hello Visitors! My name is Samuel Oduro. I am a 3rd year student at Virginia Tech majoring in the computer engineering section of controls, robotics, and autonomy. My interests include embedded systems, robotics, and machine learning. I plan to pursue a role in the future that combines these elements as the intersection between robotics and machine learing will continue to grow due to the recent growth of LLM's. 

You can learn more about me in the personal infromation tab of this website.
